<h1>You made a great choice!!</h1>

<p>Now what you have to do is, go into a ranked game and pick ADC. You don't need any practice or anything, just pick and ADC and carry that game. Ignore what everyone says. They're just there for the free win anyways.</p>
<p>
Here's a few tips to get you started:
  <ul>
  <li>Just pick a champ</li>
  <li>Don't adjust your masteries or runes</li>
  <li>Buy whatever you want</li>
  <li>Blame your teammates often to make them better</li>
  <li>Ignore everything but what you think is right</li>
  <li>Win. Rinse. Repeat</li>
