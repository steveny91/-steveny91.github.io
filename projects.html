                <p class="section-text" align="left">
                  Seems like the trend for smaller companies are single page websites for the bulk of their information. This trends seemed
                  to be fueled by simplicity, efficiency and speed. Having all the information on one page I believe saves
                  so much time needlessly having to navigate a multipage website. Granted some websites require the multi
                  pages to present everything they have to offer. But, if it all fits into one page, why not? Scrolling through
                  a single page application is also perfect for mobile phones and tablets.

                <strong>(Summary: Tenant and rent receipt manager Rails app)</strong>
              </p>
              <p class="section-text" align="left">
                This was my first paid project. It was for a friend's mother. She owns apartment buildings throughout Brooklyn. She's a very
                old school lady. She goes there personally to collect rent and also hands out the receipts. She used to do
                the receipts by hand and had to write down all the information every month. When I was told that, I asked
                why not just get the information pre-filled, printed out and then sign it by hand. So, I set out to build
                something like that for her. She was also cool with the idea of paying me for my troubles. It initially started
                with a very simple idea. A rails backend with all the information, a simple HTML page designed with CSS to
                resemble a receipt. Also, a tenant manager in case any information needed to be updated. Seems easy enough,
                right? I eventually added some extras to track apartment repairs and status. It definitely got more complexed
                then what I initially wanted for sure.

              </p>
              <p class="section-text" align="left">
                This was another fun project. I was talking to a friend and he was doing data entry for this lien company (
                <a href="https://nationalliens.org/">I also help build the website</a>). All he had to do was take some information on this sheet of paper that
                they collect from a courthouse and type it into a spreadsheet. Seems easy enough right? Well, he had a whole
                stack of them and it seemed so tedious. I wanted to help him, so I started looking online and found this
                thing called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and a free API for it called Tesseract. I started testing
                it and after a long time tinkering with it, I got it working. The idea was that he would scan the stack of
                paper that he had into a pdf and use the app to convert it to a .txt file. Once in .txt, he would then use
                the ruby script I wrote to iterate over the .txt file that takes all the relevant information and create
                a CSV (sorta like an excel file) file with them. Currently, this app is specially made for his needs as it
                would look for specific keywords and specific locations, it won't work if there are any changes made to the
                hard copy. Granted, they haven't changed the layout for 10+ years.

              <p class="section-text" align="left">
                My time at DevBoot Camp was very enjoyable. I met some very nice people, got to learn from very smart people and also built
                some very neat stuff. Two projects that I especially like were the two we had to build close to graduation.
                It was on React.js and React-Native, which wasn't thought to us before. Learning everything on the fly was
                definitely intense and having a few days to build something was even more. The react website I still have
                up on my Heroku til this day. The React website was based on the idea of a crowdsourced restaurant. Users
                can post their own unique recipes and the owner(our instructor) would pick out recipes every week to serve
                at her imaginary restaurant.
                <a href="https://madamerouge.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Link here</a>
                <br>
                <br>The React-Native one, was inspired by pokemon go and Pac-man. The idea was that the user would run around
                the street of New York collecting these coins to increase their score while avoiding these ghost enemies
                that would bring about the end of the game if caught. We added our twist to it by making our instructor chase
                facebook likes and tweets as he's obsessed with his social media. The current version of the app needs a
                ton of updating due to React-Native and IOS changes. But, It was working pretty flawlessly when it was created.
